    /// Each test class must have its own fixture and each fixture initialize and dispose a unique database
    /// So, we have control over parallel tests run and lower cost for creating database for tests
    /// ------------------* But *-----------------------------------------------
    /// If you want the fixture to be initialized and disposed for each test method in a class
    /// You just need to make a new fixture class by Inheriting from TestsBaseFixture (public class MyFixture:TestsBaseFixture)
    /// And use that new fixture class as a base for the test class (public class MyTestsClass:MyFixture)
    /// So the fixture initialize before each test method and then dispose after that test run
    /// ------------------* But *-----------------------------------------------
    /// If you want to share a fixture for all test methods in a Test Class
    /// You just need to Inherit from IClassFixture<TestsBaseFixture> for that test class
    /// And get TestsBaseFixture as a parameter in the constructor
    /// So the TestsBaseFixture initialize before all test methods in that test class and then dispose after all tests run
    /// ------------------* But *-----------------------------------------------
    /// If you want to share a fixture for all test methods in some Test Classes
    /// You just need to make a new class inherited from ICollectionFixture<TestsBaseFixture>
    /// Then apply [CollectionDefinition("my Collection Fixture")] attribute for that new class
    /// And then apply [Collection("my Collection Fixture")] attribute for those test classes you want to share the fixture between them
    /// And get the fixture as a parameter in each test class constructor
    /// So the fixture initialize before all test methods in all test classes and then dispose after all tests run
